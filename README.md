# Advent-of-Code-2015
My attempts at Advent of Code 2015 in Java.
(Only now posted because I did not know how to use git at the time)

Some days are only half done, due to me quitting due to personal reasons such as school and other things.
Also, this is almost surely not the most efficient way to do things, and my objective was only to learn so I wouldn't copy much of what I do here to use somewhere else haha
